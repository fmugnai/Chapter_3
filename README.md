### In this file collection you can find supplementary material relative at Chapter 3 of Francesco Mugnai’s PhD thesis.
#### Please note that all the CSV files have semicolon (;) as column separator.
1. The sampling location coordinates and metadata are available in Data_S1_Sample_Metadata.csv.
2. Spatial-temporal morphological data regarding the vagile fraction ≥ 2 mm (VF2000) are available in Data_S2_Spatial_temporal_morphology.csv.
3. SIMPER analyses carried out on morphological data of the vagile fraction ≥ 500µm are presented in Data_S3_SIMPER.xlsx.
4. The final normalized MOTUs table regarding COI sequencing of the whole samples is presented in Data_S4_MOTUs.csv.
5. Files from Data_S5A_Phylum_Metabarcoding.csv to Data_S5F_Species_Metabarcoding.csv include aggregated MOTUs per each taxonomic level indicated in the file name (from phylum to species).
6. The RELATE matrix carried out between the morphological and the molecular approaches and within each approach per each taxonomic level is presented in Data_S6_RELATE_matrix.xlsx.
7. The comparison between the species identified with morphological and the molecular approach individually are presented in Data_S7_morpho_molecular_comparison.xlsx
8. Figure_S1.png describes the overall sample processing of ASUs samples.
